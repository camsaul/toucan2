  1. Values for the primary key are specified in the INSERT itself, *and*

  2. The primary key is not an integer.

  So to work around this we will look at the rows we're inserting: if every rows specifies the primary key
  column(s) (including `nil` values), we'll transduce those specified values rather than what JDBC returns.

  This seems like it won't work if these values were arbitrary Honey SQL expressions. I suppose we could work around
  THAT problem by running the primary key values thru another SELECT query... but that just seems like too much. I guess
  we can cross that bridge when we get there."
