  "Implementation of [[with-temp]]. You can implement this if you need to do some sort of special behavior for a
  particular model. But normally you would just implement [[with-temp-defaults]]. If you need to do special setup when

  ```clj

  `explicit-attributes` are the attributes specified in the `with-temp` form itself, any may be `nil`. The default
  implementation merges the attributes from [[with-temp-defaults]] like

(defmacro with-temp
  "Define a temporary instance of a model and bind it to `temp-object-binding`. The object is inserted
  using [[insert/insert-returning-instances!]] using the values from [[with-temp-defaults]] merged with a map of
  `attributes`. At the conclusion of `body`, the object is deleted. This is primarily intended for usage in tests, so
  this adds a [[clojure.test/testing]] context around `body` as well.

  [[with-temp]] can create multiple objects in one form if you pass additional bindings.

  `temp-object-binding` and `attributes` are optional, and default to `_` and `nil`, respectively. If you're creating
  multiple objects at once these must be explicitly specified.

  Examples:

  ```clj
  ;;; use the with-temp-defaults for :models/bird
  (with-temp [:models/bird bird]
    (do-something bird))

  ;;; use the with-temp-defaults for :models/bird merged with {:name \"Lucky Pigeon\"}
  (with-temp [:models/bird bird {:name \"Lucky Pigeon\"}]
    (do-something bird))

  ;;; define multiple instances at the same time
  (with-temp [:models/bird bird-1 {:name \"Parroty\"}
              :models/bird bird-2 {:name \"Green Friend\", :best-friend-id (:id bird-1)}]
    (do-something bird))
  ```

  If you want to implement custom behavior for a model other than default values, you can implement [[do-with-temp*]]."
  [[modelable temp-object-binding attributes & more] & body]
  `(do-with-temp ~modelable ~attributes

                       `(with-temp ~(vec more) ~@body)
                       `(do ~@body))))))
