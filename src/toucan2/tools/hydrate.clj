(ns toucan2.tools.hydrate
  "[[hydrate]] adds one or more keys to an instance or instances using various hydration strategies, usually using one of
  the existing keys in those instances. A typical use case would be to take a sequence of `orders` and add `:user` keys
  to them based on their values of the foreign key `:user-id`.

  [[hydrate]] is how you *use* the hydration facilities; everything else in this namespace is only for extending
  hydration to support your models.

  Toucan 2 ships with several hydration strategies out of the box:

  #### Automagic Batched Hydration (via [[model-for-automagic-hydration]])

  [[hydrate]] attempts to do a *batched hydration* where possible. If the key being hydrated is defined as one of some
  table's [[model-for-automagic-hydration]], `hydrate` will do a batched
  [[toucan2.select/select]] if a corresponding key (by default, the same key suffixed by `-id`) is found in the
  objects being batch hydrated. The corresponding key can be customized by
  implementing [[fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]].

  ```clj
  (hydrate [{:user_id 100}, {:user_id 101}] :user)
  ```

  Since `:user` is a hydration key for `:models/User`, a single [[toucan2.select/select]] will used to fetch Users:

  ```clj
  (db/select :models/User :id [:in #{100 101}])
  ```

  The corresponding Users are then added under the key `:user`.

  #### Function-Based Batched Hydration (via [[batched-hydrate]] methods)

  If the key can't be hydrated auto-magically with the appropriate [[model-for-automagic-hydration]],
  [[hydrate]] will attempt to do batched hydration if it can find a matching method
  for [[batched-hydrate]]. If a matching function is found, it is called with a collection of
  objects, e.g.

  ```clj
  (m/defmethod hydrate/batched-hydrate [:default :fields]
    [_model _k instances]
    (let [id->fields (get-some-fields instances)]
      (for [instance instances]
        (assoc instance :fields (get id->fields (:id instance))))))
  ```

  #### Simple Hydration (via [[simple-hydrate]] methods)

  If the key is *not* eligible for batched hydration, [[hydrate]] will look for a matching
  [[simple-hydrate]] method. `simple-hydrate` is called with a single instance.

  ```clj
  (m/defmethod simple-hydrate [:default :dashboard]
    [_model _k {:keys [dashboard-id], :as instance}]
    (assoc instance :dashboard (select/select-one :models/Dashboard :toucan/pk dashboard-id)))
  ```

  #### Hydrating Multiple Keys

  You can hydrate several keys at one time:

  ```clj
  (hydrate {...} :a :b)
    -> {:a 1, :b 2}
  ```

  #### Nested Hydration

  You can do recursive hydration by listing keys inside a vector:

  ```clj
  (hydrate {...} [:a :b])
    -> {:a {:b 1}}
  ```

  The first key in a vector will be hydrated normally, and any subsequent keys will be hydrated *inside* the
  corresponding values for that key.

  ```clj
  (hydrate {...}
           [:a [:b :c] :e])
    -> {:a {:b {:c 1} :e 2}}
  ```

  ### Forcing Hydration

  Normally, hydration is skipped if an instance already has a non-nil value for the key being hydrated, but you can
  override this behavior by implementing [[needs-hydration?]].

  ### Flowchart

  If you're digging in to the details, this is a flowchart of how hydration works:

  ```clj

  Dispatches off of the [[toucan2.protocols/dispatch-value]] (normally [[toucan2.protocols/model]]) of the instance
  being hydrated and the key `k` that we are attempting to hydrate. To hydrate the key `k` for *any* model, you can use
  `:default` in your `defmethod` dispatch value. Example implementation:

  ```clj
  ;; when hydrating the :user key for *any* model, hydrate with instances of the model :models/user
  ;;
  ;; By default, this will look for values of :user-id in the instances being hydrated and then fetch the instances of

  ```

  Automagic hydration looks for the [[fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]] in the instance being hydrated, and if they're
  all non-`nil`, fetches instances of [[model-for-automagic-hydration]] with the
  corresponding [[toucan2.model/primary-keys]]. Thus you might also want to implement

  - [[fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]] for the model whose instances hydrating and the key being hydrated
    (e.g. `:models/orders` and `:user`)

  - [[toucan2.model/primary-keys]] for the model you want to hydrate with (e.g. `:models/user`)

  #### Tips

  - You probably don't want to write an implementation for `[<some-model> :default]` or `[:default :default]`, unless
    you want every key that we attempt to hydrate to be hydrated by that method."

  ```

  The model that we are hydrating with (e.g. `:models/user`) is determined by [[model-for-automagic-hydration]].

  By default [[fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]] is just the key we're hydrating, with `-id` appended to it; e.g. if
  we're hydrating `:user` the default FK key to use is `:user-id`. *If this convention is fine, you do not need to
  implement this method.* If you want to do something that does not follow this convention, like hydrate a `:user` key
  based on values of `:creator-id`, you should implement this method.

  Example implementation:

  ```clj
  ;; hydrate orders :user key using values of :creator-id
  (m/defmethod hydrate/fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration [:model/orders :user :default]

  #### Tips

  When implementing this method, you probably do not want to specialize on the `hydrating-model` (the third part of the
  dispatch value) -- the model to use is normally determined by [[model-for-automagic-hydration]]. The only time you
  might want to specialize on `hydrating-model` is you wanted to do something like

  ```clj

  Batched hydration implementations should try to be efficient, e.g. minimizing the number of database calls made rather
  than doing one call per instance. If you just want to hydrate each instance independently,
  implement [[simple-hydrate]] instead. If you are hydrating entire instances of some other model, consider setting up
  automagic batched hydration using [[model-for-automagic-hydration]] and possibly [[fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]]."
