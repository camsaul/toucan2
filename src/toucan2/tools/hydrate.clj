(defn hydrate
  "Hydrate a single object or sequence of objects.

  #### Automagic Batched Hydration (via [[toucan2.hydrate/table-for-automagic-hydration]])

  [[toucan2.hydrate/hydrate]] attempts to do a *batched hydration* where possible. If the key being hydrated is
  defined as one of some table's [[toucan2.hydrate/table-for-automagic-hydration]], `hydrate` will do a batched
  [[toucan2.select/select]] if a corresponding key (by default, the same key suffixed by `-id`) is found in the
  objects being batch hydrated. The corresponding key can be customized by
  implementing [[toucan2.hydrate/fk-keys-for-automagic-hydration]].

    (hydrate [{:user_id 100}, {:user_id 101}] :user)

  Since `:user` is a hydration key for `:models/User`, a single [[toucan2.select/select]] will used to fetch Users:

    (db/select :models/User :id [:in #{100 101}])

  The corresponding Users are then added under the key `:user`.

  #### Function-Based Batched Hydration (via [[toucan2.hydrate/batched-hydrate]] methods)

  If the key can't be hydrated auto-magically with the appropriate [[toucan2.hydrate/table-for-automagic-hydration]],
  [[toucan2.hydrate/hydrate]] will attempt to do batched hydration if it can find a matching method
  for [[toucan2.hydrate/batched-hydrate]]. If a matching function is found, it is called with a collection of
  objects, e.g.

    (m/defmethod hydrate/batched-hydrate [:default :fields]
      [_model _k rows]
      (let [id->fields (get-some-fields rows)]
        (for [row rows]
          (assoc row :fields (get id->fields (:id row))))))

  #### Simple Hydration (via [[toucan2.hydrate/simple-hydrate]] methods)

  If the key is *not* eligible for batched hydration, [[toucan2.hydrate/hydrate]] will look for a matching
  [[toucan2.hydrate/simple-hydrate]] method. `simple-hydrate` is called with a single row.

    (m/defmethod simple-hydrate [:default :dashboard]
      [_model _k {:keys [dashboard-id], :as row}]
      (assoc row :dashboard (select/select-one :models/Dashboard :toucan/pk dashboard-id)))

  #### Hydrating Multiple Keys

  You can hydrate several keys at one time:

    (hydrate {...} :a :b)
      -> {:a 1, :b 2}

  #### Nested Hydration

  You can do recursive hydration by listing keys inside a vector:

    (hydrate {...} [:a :b])
      -> {:a {:b 1}}

  The first key in a vector will be hydrated normally, and any subsequent keys will be hydrated *inside* the
  corresponding values for that key.

    (hydrate {...}
             [:a [:b :c] :e])
      -> {:a {:b {:c 1} :e 2}}"
  [results k & ks]
  (when results
    (if (sequential? results)
      (if (empty? results)
        results
        (let [first-row (first results)]
          (apply hydrate-forms (instance/model first-row) results k ks)))
      (first (apply hydrate-forms (instance/model results) [results] k ks)))))
