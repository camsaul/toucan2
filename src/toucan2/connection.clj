  "#### Connection Resolution

  The rules for determining which connection to use are as follows. These are tried in order until one returns
  non-nil:

  1. The connectable specified in the function arguments.

  2. The [[toucan2.connection/*current-connectable*]], if bound. This is bound automatically when
     using [[with-connection]] or [[with-transaction]]

  3. The [[toucan2.model/default-connectable]] for the model resolved from the `modelable` in the function arguments;

  4. The `:default` implementation of [[toucan2.connection/do-with-connection]]

  You can define a 'named' connectable such as `::db` by adding an implementation
  of [[toucan2.connection/do-with-connection]], or use things like JDBC URL connection strings or [[clojure.java.jdbc]]
  connection properties maps directly.

  IMPORTANT CAVEAT! Positional connectables will be used in preference to [[*current-connectable*]], even when it was
  bound by [[with-transaction]] -- this means your query will run OUTSIDE of the current transaction! Sometimes, this is
  what you want, because maybe a certain query is meant to run against a different database! Usually, however, it is
  not! So in that case you can either do something like

  ```clj
  (t2/query (or conn/*current-connectable* ::my-db) ...)
  ```

  to use the current connection if it exists, or define your named connectable method like

  ```clj
  (m/defmethod conn/do-with-connection ::my-db
    [_connectable f]
    (conn/do-with-connection
     (if (and conn/*current-connectable*
              (not= conn/*current-connectable* ::my-db))
         conn/*current-connectable*
         \"jdbc:postgresql://...\")
     f))
  ```

  This, however, is super annoying! So I might reconsider this behavior in the future.

  For reducible queries, the connection is not resolved until the query is executed, so you may create a reducible query
  with no default connection available and execute it later with one bound. (This also means
  that [[toucan2.execute/reducible-query]] does not capture dynamic bindings such
  as [[toucan2.connection/*current-connectable*]] -- you probably wouldn't want it to, anyway, since we have no
  guarantees and open connection will be around when we go to use the reducible query later.

  The default JDBC implementations for methods here live in [[toucan2.jdbc.connection]]."

  connectable, such as a JDBC connection string URL. You can do that like this:

(defmacro with-connection
  "Execute `body` with an open connection. There are three ways to use this.

  With no args in the bindings vector, `with-connection` will use the *current connection* -- [[*current-connectable*]]
  if one is bound, or the *default connectable* if not. See docstring for [[toucan2.connection]] for more information.

  ```clj
  (t2/with-connection []
    ...)
  ```

  With one arg, `with-connection` still uses the *current connection*, but binds it to something (`conn` in the example
  below):

  ```clj
  (t2/with-connection [conn]
    ...)
  ```

  If you're using the default JDBC backend, `conn` will be an instance of `java.sql.Connection`. Since Toucan 2 is also
  written to work with other backend besides JDBC, `conn` does *not* include `java.sql.Connection` `:tag` metadata! If
  you're doing Java interop with `conn`, make sure to tag it yourself:

  ```clj
   (t2/with-connection [^java.sql.Connection conn]
     (let [metadata (.getMetaData conn)]
       ...))
  ```

  With a connection binding *and* a connectable:

  ```clj
  (t2/with-connection [conn ::my-connectable]
    ...)
  ```

  This example gets a connection by calling [[do-with-connection]] with `::my-connectable`, ignoring the *current
  connection*."
