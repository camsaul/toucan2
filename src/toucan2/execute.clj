(ns toucan2.execute
  "Code for executing queries and statements, and reducing their results.

  The functions here meant for use on a regular basis are:

  * [[query]] -- resolve and compile a connectable, execute it using a connection from a connectable, and immediately
                 fully realize the results.

  * [[query-one]] -- like [[query]], but only realizes the first result.

  * [[reducible-query]] -- like [[query]], but returns a [[clojure.lang.IReduceInit]] that can be reduced later rather
    than immediately realizing the results.

  * [[with-call-count]] -- helper macro to count the number of queries executed within a `body`."

  "Create a reducible query that when reduced with resolve and compile `queryable`, open a connection using `connectable`
  and [[toucan2.connection/with-connection]], execute the query, and reduce the results.

  Note that this query can be something like a `SELECT` query, or something that doesn't normally return results, like
  an `UPDATE`; this works either way. Normally something like an `UPDATE` will reduce to the number of rows
  updated/inserted/deleted, e.g. `[5]`.

  You can specify `modelable` to execute the query in the context of a specific model; for queries returning rows, the
  rows will be returned as an [[toucan2.instance/instance]] of the resolved model.

  See [[toucan2.connection]] for Connection resolution rules."
