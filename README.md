# Toucan 2

![Toucan 2](https://github.com/camsaul/toucan2/blob/master/assets/toucan2.png)

Toucan 2 is a successor library to [Toucan](https://github.com/metabase/toucan) with a modern and more-extensible API,
more consistent behavior, and support for different backends including non-JDBC databases and non-HoneySQL queries.

After working on this off and on for several years I decided that the library was overly complicated (at nearly 8000
lines of code) and decided to start over and re-implement things in a simpler fashion. The old library was mostly
usable and tested and several alpha releases are available on Clojars. It's available in the
[`old-implementation`](https://github.com/camsaul/toucan2/tree/old-implementation) branch.

The re-implementation is pretty close to being ready for alpha usage and I will update the README when I publish the
first alpha release.
