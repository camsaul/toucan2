# Toucan 2

![Toucan 2](https://github.com/camsaul/toucan2/blob/master/assets/toucan2.png)

Toucan 2 is a successor library to [Toucan](https://github.com/metabase/toucan) with a modern and more-extensible API,
more consistent behavior (less gotchas), support for different backends including non-JDBC databases and non-HoneySQL
queries, and more useful utilities.

Toucan 2 uses [Honey SQL 2](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql),
[`next.jdbc`](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc) (a bit), and
[Methodical](https://github.com/camsaul/methodical) under the hood. Everything is super efficient and reducible under
the hood (even inserts, updates, and deletes!) and magical (in a good way).

The library is mostly usable now but I have a big pile of things to do before the
official announcement -- [take a look at the Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DFx8rVa8/toucan-2-todo) -- when things
get a little further along I'll move things over to GitHub issues. I will update this README when I publish the first
alpha release.

# `toucan2-toucan1`

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/io.github.camsaul/toucan2-toucan1/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.github.camsaul/toucan2-toucan1)

Compatibility layer for projects using [Toucan 1](https://github.com/metabase/toucan) to ease transition to Toucan 2.
Implements the same namespaces as Toucan 1, but they are implemented on top of Toucan 2. Projects using Toucan 1 can
remove their dependency on `toucan`, and include a dependency on `io.github.camsaul/toucan2-toucan1` in its place;
with a few changes your project should work without having to switch everything to Toucan 2 all at once. More details
on this coming soon.

See [`toucan2-toucan1` docs](toucan1/README.md) for more information.
